Simple Work Day planner

Here I have built a simple yet aesthetically pleasing planner application.
The user is able to input tasks into the time blocks to assist them with planning day to day activities.
The date displayed up top will update with the current date.

Functions to be added include:
updating the planner to show what time of day it is with color coding of time boxes.
A save and clear function to save tasks to local storage and a clear all button if the user did not want to refresh the page
after saving blank time slots.
